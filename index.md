## Welcome to the Jornada Ecological Data Science site

Our aim is to teach introductory and intermediate data science to Jornada researchers using accessible methods and relatable data.

## Setting up your environment

Most tutorials have been developed for learners using `R`, `python`, and other open-source tools. To set up an environment to work through lessons on your own or in a workshop, follow the [setup instructions](./html/setup.html) that apply to your lesson. Lessons rely on either simulated data or Jornada data hosted at EDI. The [teaching datasets page](./html/teaching-datasets.html) will introduce these datasets and how to load them. Additional required software packages and suggestions for loading the data are given at the start of each lesson.

## Lessons

1. [Hypothesis testing with general linear models and mixed models](./html/statistical-inference-linear-and-mixed.html)
2. [Using git and GitHub as a researcher](./html/git-and-github-for-research.html) (Not ready yet)
