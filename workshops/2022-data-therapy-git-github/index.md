# 2022 Data Therapy: Git/GitHub Sessions

**ONLINE -Date and time:** See the [calendar invite](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=YWlta3ZsZDUzbzdsM3VkbWVjN2ZwNDExbzBfMjAyMjA5MDhUMjEwMDAwWiBkczVtNnF0NTRsYm9xYm85Z3QxNDhzcjJjMEBn)

**Instructors:** Greg Maurer

We will start this with a 1-hour beginner-level tutorial on using `git` and GitHub as a researcher. You'll learn a little about why you might want to incorporate `git` into your scientific workflows, and how to get started doing that. Future sessions 
will cover more advanced topics. Using `git` and GitHub effectively takes quite
a bit of practice, so we'll cover the basics and leave room for adding more
tutorials down the road (open to suggestions on that).

## Getting set up

Basically you will need to install `git` and make yourself an account at <https://github.com>. There are quite a few ways to do this, but check the JEDS [setup instructions](../../html/setup) for some recommended ones.

If you have trouble preparing or need help please contact Greg (<gmaurer@nmsu.edu>).
