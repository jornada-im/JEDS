# 2023 Data Therapy: Geospatial Data Access

**ONLINE - Date and time:** See the [calendar invite](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=YWlta3ZsZDUzbzdsM3VkbWVjN2ZwNDExbzBfMjAyMjA5MDhUMjEwMDAwWiBkczVtNnF0NTRsYm9xYm85Z3QxNDhzcjJjMEBn)

**Instructors:** Greg Maurer


## Getting set up

Familiarize yourself with the Jornada spatial data catalog, such as it is right now: <https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/#uagb-tabs__tab3>. It would also be good to have a desktop GIS software installed on your computer or laptop. I recommend [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) for most people since it is open-source, free, and powerful. [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/) is also free, but a bit less powerful. If you have a license for ArcGIS Desktop or Pro, that will also work. For using R (if we get to that) you should have R installed and set up as per the JEDS [setup instructions](../../html/setup), and also install the R packages `terra` and `sf`.

If you have trouble preparing or need help please contact Greg (<gmaurer@nmsu.edu>).
