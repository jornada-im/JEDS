# Accessing Jornada geospatial data

## 1. Where are the data?

* The [Jornada LTER website spatial data catalog](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/#uagb-tabs__tab3)
* The Jornada Experimental Range (JER) geodatabase (not public-facing)
* The Jornada IM team's geodatabase (same as above, but not public facing.... yet)
* A few spatial datasets are published in the Environmental Data Initiative repository, but we are working on more.

## 2. Who should I ask for data?

* Most of the time you should ask a Jornada data manager (<jornada.data@nmsu.edu>) and/or Amy Slaughter (<amalia.slaughter@usda.gov>), who maintains the JER geodatabase.

## 3. How should I use the data?

Its up to you, but a few tools we can recommend:

* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is open-source, free, and powerful, and is installable on Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms. 
* [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/) is also free, but a bit less powerful.
* [ArcGIS Desktop](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview) or [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) are great you have a license for them. Sometimes you can get a license through your institution. Many institutions also offer access to ArcGIS Online, a cloud-native GIS platform that integrates with the desktop ones.
* For R users, you should have R installed and set up as per the JEDS [setup instructions](../html/setup), and also install the R packages `terra` and `sf`, which are highly functional for raster and vector data, respectively.
* For python users, a good place to start might be GeoPandas, but there are many more options.

## 4. What about other kinds of data?

There are lots.... we're going to work on providing links to "non-Jornada data about the Jornada" in the future too. This might include remote sensing or derived products, regional to global modeling data, federal agency data, etc.

[The survey](https://forms.gle/VQ5Nc7YUZv4Wb7go9) will help us figure out what is most valuable here.
